            <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I have worked on several projects in my free time. Sometimes I
              have a specific goal in mind when I start a project but often I
              only looking to try out new tools. I am most interested in
              learning software architecture so figuring out how to select the
              right tools and build systems from the ground up is important to
              me. I started as many do with a stack with a low learning curve
              and tutorials in plentitude (react/express/bootstrap). Using these
              tools helped me appreciate how to build modular user interfaces
              and seperate the display details from the business logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time working with React I became interested in exploring
              how libraries implement server-side rendering. My disorganized
              ruminations can be found over on my github page under the name
              <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spintronics/astral"
                >Astral</a
              >. There is virtually no substance to this project. It was simply
              a playground to try out a few ideas. I was fascinated by the
              possibility of reusing server and client code to reduce
              complexity. Since the server needed to have access to the client
              components I had to figure out a way to preserve the continuity
              between the server-side render of a page and the client side.
            </p>
            <p>
              My current project is my most ambitious to date.
              <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spintronics/Graphite"
                >Graphite</a

              is intended to be a learning management system similar to Canvas.
              Admittedly, this idea is not particularly original but I am mostly
              using it to practice the art of software architecture. I have gone
              through several iterations of building the foundation for this
              project. The way I see it, one of the biggest problems in building
              large software systems is that of managing complexity. In
              particular I tend to balk at the idea of defining the same models
              in different languages on both the server and client. This
              inevitably leads to overhead in keeping the two in sync. Typically
              we define some object first by describing how it will be stored in
              the database using a schema. We then take that description and
              build our back-end models based on their shape. Next, we build an
              api so that the client can interface with these objects. The
              problem is that we must define this additional interface to bridge
              the gap between the two systems. Each change to the schema now
              requires that we update the server, client, and api models to
              preserve the interoperability of the two. I spent considerable
              time trying to find a way to avoid this wasteful scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew that I wanted to use Flutter to implement the user
              interface for this application because of its promise of
              effortless cross-platform compatibility across all devices.
              Choosing this tool came with a price though. It did not seem to me
              like Dart was a language with a sufficiently robust toolset for
              building webservers. Since I did not want to define my models in
              two different languages I decided to use a tool called gRPC to act
              as the interface between the client and server. The most useful
              feature of gRPC is that it can generate stubs for both the client
              and server. This allows me to define my models in one place then
              generate typesafe equivalents in my two languages, Dart and Go. I
              then take these stubs and write wrapper classes in each language
              to implement the domain-specific functionality. Unfortunately, I
              still needed to redefine these models in an ORM but I found that
              to be only a minor inconvenience since servers generally need to
              translate their models to database equivalents anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have test cases for each user story implemented by the server. I
              also implemented the beginnings of a role-based authentication
              system and a client state management solution. My next task is to
              build an administration site to interact with the database from
              the client. This is a good feature to implement first, since it is
              required and helps to test out the functionality of the system as
              it is being developed. If this ever becomes a real product I would
              like to keep it open-source and market it towards home-schooling
              parents as a better way to help manage their children's education.

            <h2>School Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I used python and pygame to build a
              <a

                href="https://github.com/spintronics/connect_four"
                >Connect Four</a
              >
              game with a few classmates. I devised the initial work plan and
              built a UI by defining a set of components and then composing them
              together. I also helped write the AI for the game and spent some
              time optimizing the code. Although I had used python several times
              before, this was a great opportunity to get more hands-on practice
              in a bigger application.
            </p>
            <h2>Work Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I built large portions of the e-commerce website for
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acehardware.com/"
                >Ace Hardware</a
              >. I built the account and checkout pages and implemented several
              features for the product/category search pages. I also built an
              integration for their customer rewards system. This project was a
              huge undertaking and I learned much during my time working on it.
