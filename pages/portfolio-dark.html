            <p>
              I have worked an several projects in my free time. Sometimes I
              have a specific goal in mind when I start a project but often I am
              just using an idea as focus to try out new tools. I am most
              interested in learning software architecture so learning how to
              select the right tools and build a system from the ground up is
              important to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              When i first started trying to create projects, I tried to use the
              most common tools at the time (react/express/bootstrap). Using
              these tools helped me appreciate how to build a modular user
              interface and seperate the display details from the business
              logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next time I started a project I was interested in exploring
              how libraries implement server-side rendering. My disorganized
              ruminations can be found over on my github page under the name
              <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spintronics/astral"
                >Astral</a
              >. There is virtually no substance to this project. It was simply
              a playground to try out a few ideas. I was fascinated by the
              posibility of reusing server and client code to manage complexity.
              Since the server needed to have access to the client components I
              had to figure out a way to preserve the continuity between the
              server-side render of a page and the client side. Although I
              eventually created a crudely working implementation, I would do it
              differently now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next I will describe my current project, which has been my most
              ambitious to date.

              is currently a work in progress where I am trying to build a
              learning management system similar to Canvas. Admittedly, this
              idea is not particularly original but again I am using it to
              practice the art of software architecture. I have gone through
              several iterations of building the foundation for this project.
              The way I see it, one of the biggest problems in building large
              software systems is managing complexity. In particular I tend to
              balk at the idea of defining the same models in different
              languages on both the server and client. This inevitably leads to
              overhead in keeping the two in sync. Typically we define some
              object first by describing how it will be stored in the database
              using a schema. We then take that description and build our
              back-end models based on its shape. Next we build an api so that
              the client can interface with these objects. The problem is that
              we must define a this additional interface to bridge the gap
              between these two systems. Each change to the schema now requires
              that we update the server, client, and api models to preserve the
              interoperability of the system. This is incredibly wasteful and so
              I spent considerable time trying to find a way to avoid this. I
              will skip the details of my first few attempts instead describe my
              current solution to this problem.
            </p>

              I knew that I wanted to use Flutter to implement the user
              interface for this application because of the promise of
              effortless cross-platform compatability across all devices.
              Choosing this tool came with a price though. It did not seem to me
              like Dart was a language which had robust tooling for building
              webservers. Since I did not want to define my models in two
              different languages I decided to use a tool called gRPC to act as
              the interface between the client and server. The most useful
              feature of gRPC is that it can generate stubs for both the client
              and server. Essentially it allows me to define my models in one
              place then generate typesafe equivalents in my two languages, Dart
              and Go. This allows me to write models specific to each domain
              that extend the structure of these shared models. Unfortunately I
              still needed to redefine the models in an ORM but i found that to
              be a small issue since servers generally need to translate their
              models to database equivalents anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started with test-driven development and then implemented the
              core functionality to pass those cases. My next task is to build
              an administration site to interact with the database from the
              client. This is a good feature to implement first since it is
              required and helps to test out the functionality of the system as
              it is being developed. If this every becomes a real product I
              would like to keep it open-source and market it towards
              home-schooling parents as a better way to help manage their
              children's education.
